Week 4 Homework JS quiz. 

After asking Farish if the quiz needed to be about HTML,CSS, JS or what we have learned, I was instructed, "what matters is the code..." So, I decided to make a fun quiz about one of my favorite shows: Rick and Morty. 

If it needs to be changed I do have HTML,CSS,and JS questions written out for the sake of the quiz. 

If I need to resubmit this homework due to the questions please let me know ahead of time so I can get the appropriate grading. Thank you and hope you enjoy! Link is below for the github.io
